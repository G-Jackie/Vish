The EU-funded Global Excursion Project aims to improve the science curriculum at upper stage school levels (i.e. pupils in the 14-18 age range) through an innovative e-platform called the Virtual Science Hub (ViSH).<br/><br/>

About ViSH<br/><br/>The Virtual Science Hub is a meeting point for scientists and teachers and is based around the idea of “Virtual Excursions”, the online analog to an on-site visit, during which the students discover science in Europe’s top scientific centers. Several media such as flashcards, video-conference and virtual experiments help them feel the science rather than just study it.

ViSH will be using Social Stream as a social networking library and it is entering its development phase. You can find the code at the GING github page.
