		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
		GLOBAL excursion (Extended Curriculum for Science Infrastructure Online) is a support action funded by the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme --<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/infrastructures/index_en.cfm" target="_blank">FP7</a> and attributed to <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/connect/mission/index_en.htm#DirC" target="_blank">DG Connect – Excellence in Science – Digital Science.</a> The aims of GLOBAL excursion are basically twofold: on the one hand we envision to enrich science teaching in European schools and on the other hand we offer researchers and their institutions a promotion channel towards a school audience.
		</p>

		<p>
		Via a central web portal, called the <a href="http://www.globalexcursion-project.eu/?page_id=21" target="_blank">Virtual Science Hub – “ViSH”</a> we provide scientists, teachers and their pupils as well as policy makers a package of activities, materials, and tools for enabling the integration of e-Infrastructures into school curricula. ViSH supports a set of resources that can be uploaded to the platform and be made available for all the users: images, objects (flash objects), videos, live objects: webcams or microscopes provided by the e-Infrastructures.
		</p>

		</p>
		As the project is heading to its conclusion, the consortium has decided to organise a competition that will contribute to the further dissemination of ViSH to its various stakeholders plus reward a number of teachers and scientists that have been particularly active regarding the creation of eExcursions.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Categories</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>The two (2) best eExcursions will be selected in the following categories:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>1.      Maths</li>
		<li>2.      Physics</li>
		<li>3.      Chemistry</li>
		<li>4.      Biology</li>
		<li>5.      Environmental studies</li>

		<h2>Competition terms and conditions</h2>
		<hr>
		<h4>Participating countries</h4>
		 
		<p>The competition for the best eExcursions is open to any registered ViSH user, independently of his/her country of origin. We encourage especially teachers, scientists and scientific organisations to create excursions.</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Submissions</h4>

		<hr>
		<h3>Who can participate?</h3>
		<p>Individuals and organisations can participate.The competition for best eExcursions is open to <strong>any registered ViSH user.</strong></p>

		<p>We encourage especially teachers, scientists and scientific organisations to create excursions. But, if you are not a professional, your contribution is welcome as well. We are true supporters of open and citizen-led science!</p>
		<br>
		<h3>How to register for the competition:</h3>

		<p>To register to the competition you must tag your eExcursion with the tag:</p>
		<p>ViSHCompetition2013</p>

		<p>and with the tag of the category you would like to compete:</p>
		<p><strong>Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, EnvironmentalStudies, Geography, Engineering, Humanities, NaturalScience, ComputerScience</strong></p>
		<p>An eExcursion can be send to more than one category.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Objectives and requirements</h3>
		<p>Participants are asked to submit an eExcursion through the online <a href="http://www.globalexcursion-project.eu/?page_id=21" target="_blank">Virtual Science Hub – “ViSH”</a> portal.</p> 

		<p><i>What is an e-Excursion and what it should include?</i></p>
		<p>An eExcursion is a kind of presentation created with multimedia didactical material which allows a better understanding of a scientific infrastructure, equipment of facility. eExcursions are didactical units used for science teaching, either shown in class or to be explored by students on their own.
		An eExcursion should include one or more of the following: text, images, videos, flash objects (games, simulations, etc.), remote e-Infrastructure resources (live webcams, remote labs, etc.), quizzes, etc. that can be found through the ViSH portal.</p>

		<h4>Examples</h4>

		<p>Please find below some examples of inspiring eExcursions that can help you prepare you own submission:</p>

		<p>Iberian Lynx: <a href="http://vishub.org/excursions/55" target="_blank">http://vishub.org/excursions/55</a></p>
		<p>Outerspace: <a href="http://vishub.org/excursions/56" target="_blank">http://vishub.org/excursions/56</a></p>

		<p>More specific guidelines of how to create eExcursions and use the different features of the eExcursion editor can be found in the ViSH user manual, which can be downloaded here: <a href="http://vishub.org/user_manual" target="_blank">http://vishub.org/user_manual</a></p>
		<br>
		<h3>Selection criteria and evaluation</h3>

		<p>After the submission deadline on 20 November 2013, all eExcursions will be ranked according to the number of favourites voted by the user community on ViSH. The first 10 ranked excursions will then be judged, by a dedicated board, according to the following criteria:</p>

		<ul>

		<li>1.Originality & Appeal: Pertinence, novelty, creativity and didactical approach, will all be taken into account during the evaluation process.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>2.Pedagogical Value: Clear goals and objectives, motivation, presentation of resources, specific learning tasks, adaptability to individual needs will be taken into account during the evaluation process.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>3.Interactivity: Superior level of creativity focusing on content, design, technological innovation, and the unique nature of the underlying idea;  good understanding of the theme and conveying convincing implementation methods, solutions and messages are going to be taken into account.
		</li>

		</ul>
		<br>
		<h3>Awards & prizes</h3>
		 
		<p>A total of 23 winners will receive prizes in the form of Amazon vouchers. For each of the above mentioned categories there is a chance to win a 1st and 2nd prize:</p>
