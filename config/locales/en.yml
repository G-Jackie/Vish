    introduction3: "DG Connect – Excellence in Science – Digital Science."
    introduction4: " The aims of GLOBAL excursion are basically twofold: on the one hand we envision to enrich science teaching in European schools and on the other hand we offer researchers and their institutions a promotion channel towards a school audience."
    introduction5: "Via a central web portal, called the "
    introduction6: "Virtual Science Hub – “ViSH”"
    introduction7: " we provide scientists, teachers and their pupils as well as policy makers a package of activities, materials, and tools for enabling the integration of e-Infrastructures into school curricula. ViSH supports a set of resources that can be uploaded to the platform and be made available for all the users: images, objects (flash objects), videos, live objects: webcams or microscopes provided by the e-Infrastructures."
    introduction8: "As the project is heading to its conclusion, the consortium has decided to organise a competition that will contribute to the further dissemination of ViSH to its various stakeholders plus reward a number of teachers and scientists that have been particularly active regarding the creation of eExcursions."

    title: "Frequently Answered Questions"
    question1: "What is ViSH?"
    answer1: "The Virtual Science Hub is a meeting point for scientists and teachers and is based around the idea of “Virtual Excursions”, the online analog to an on-site visit, during which the students discover science in Europe’s top scientific centers. Several media such as flashcards, video-conference and virtual experiments help them feel the science rather than just study it. ViSH will be using Social Stream as a social networking library and it is entering its development phase. You can find the code at the GING github page."
    question2: "What is Global Excursion?"
    answer2: "It is a FP7 European Project, funded by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme. It is coordinated by ZSI and the consortium is formed by UPM, AGORA SYSTEMS, EUN, SZTAKI, UCAM and UNIZAR. Check this <a href='http://www.globalexcursion-project.eu' target='_blank'>http://www.globalexcursion-project.eu</a>"
    question3: "What is the eScience?"
    answer3: "eScience stands for “enhanced” science, in the sense of transdisciplinarity, global teams addressing large scale challenges, thanks to the use of new ICT tools and facilities. Include topics like high performance computing, large storage of data, complex networks of sensors, broadband communications, open repositories, new instrumentation, visualization tools…"
    
    editor_question1: "What is ViSH Editor?"

    competitions_question1: "Do I need to register in Vishub?"

    competitions_answer2: "Sure! the more the better. Make use of your network, your contents, your ideas… and you will have more chances to win.
