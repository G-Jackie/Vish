    title: "Frequently Answered Questions"
    question1: "What is ViSH?"
    answer1: "The Virtual Science Hub is a meeting point for scientists and teachers and is based around the idea of “Virtual Excursions”, the online analog to an on-site visit, during which the students discover science in Europe’s top scientific centers. Several media such as flashcards, video-conference and virtual experiments help them feel the science rather than just study it. ViSH will be using Social Stream as a social networking library and it is entering its development phase. You can find the code at the GING github page."
    question2: "What is Global Excursion?"
    answer2: "It is a FP7 European Project, funded by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme. It is coordinated by ZSI and the consortium is formed by UPM, AGORA SYSTEMS, EUN, SZTAKI, UCAM and UNIZAR. Check this <a href='http://www.globalexcursion-project.eu' target='_blank'>http://www.globalexcursion-project.eu</a>"
    question3: "What is the eScience?"
    answer3: "eScience stands for “enhanced” science, in the sense of transdisciplinarity, global teams addressing large scale challenges, thanks to the use of new ICT tools and facilities.
